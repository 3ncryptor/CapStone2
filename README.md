# 💰 FinBuddy – Your Personal Budgeting Companion

FinBuddy is a sleek, modern, and beginner-friendly budgeting and expense planning tool built using **Vite + React**. It helps users allocate their salary into categories like investments, savings, and spendable income, and further break down spendable amounts into groceries, wants, and custom-defined categories.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter your **monthly salary**.
2. App automatically calculates:
   - 20% for investments
   - 20% for savings
   - 60% for spendable
3. You can modify these percentages as long as the **total doesn’t exceed your salary**.
4. Further break down your **spendable** budget into categories.
5. The app keeps your finances in check with real-time validations.
